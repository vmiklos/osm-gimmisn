# Introduction

osm-gimmisn is a web-based tool to find objects missing from the OpenStreetMap database. As a start,
it finds missing streets and house numbers based on a reference list.

The latest version is v7.4, released on 2022-08-02. See the [release notes](news.md).

It works by fetching the street and house number list for a relation (area), then suggesting what
possibly missing objects are a good idea to survey.

You can see this in action at public instances: [vmiklos.hu](https://osm-gimmisn.vmiklos.hu/),
