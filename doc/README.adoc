= Using osm-gimmisn

== Up to date list of missing streets and house numbers

The https://vmiklos.pythonanywhere.com/osm[website] provides you with hints regarding where to map
house numbers. The main page has the following columns:

- House number coverage: lists missing house numbers.

- Existing house numbers for an area: this is from the OSM database.

- Street coverage: lists missing streets.

- Existing streets for an area: this is from the OSM database.

- Area on the OSM website, you can see its boundary clearly there.

It is recommended to focus on the house number coverage, at least initially. If you see an
interesting area there, then you can find hints regarding what to survey. Consider the case when the
area is already in the list, the house number is indeed missing, and you just created an OSM change
to add it. The website is automatically updated in this case on a daily basis. You can refresh
manually if you want faster feedback:

- Wait a few minutes. If you just edited OSM, then running an overpass query right now will likely
  work with outdated data.

- Go to the existing house numbers section of your area, and click on the 'Call Overpass to update'
  link.

- Once the query is complete, you'll be redirected to the house number coverage page, and the
  updated content should no longer mention your contributed house number(s) as missing anymore.

The missing house numbers are colored:

- black means a residential house number

- blue means a commercial house number (text view: '*' suffix)

NOTE: in case there is both a letter suffix and a source suffix, then the syntax is '42/A*', i.e.
first the letter suffix, and then the source suffix.

== How to add a new area

A settlement, village or district of a large city is represented in the OSM database as relations.
Based on this, osm-gimmisn refers to managed areas as relations. To add a new relation, you need to
do the following steps:

- Be prepared to edit the https://github.com/vmiklos/osm-gimmisn[git repository]. This is possible
  via command-line `git clone` or via
  https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository[web-based editing].

- Search for the relation on https://www.openstreetmap.org[osm.org], e.g. 'Kelenföld, Budapest'. The
  first hit is usually a relation link, e.g. https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2700869. Now you
  know the OSM identifier of the relation.

You'll also need the county reference ('refmegye' below) and settlement reference ('reftelepules'
below) of the area, you can find help regarding this in the
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Hungary/Tal%C3%A1lkoz%C3%B3k/2019-04-29_Oktogon_sv%C3%A9dasztal_%C3%A9s_k%C3%B6rny%C3%A9ke#Hi.C3.A1nyz.C3.B3_h.C3.A1zsz.C3.A1mok[wiki].

(These codes are specific to Hungary, but in case your country has a larger and smaller container
for streets and house numbers, it's easy to adapt.)

- Add a new entry to the `data/relations.yaml` file in the git repository, using the following form:

----
kelenfold:
    missing-streets: "no"
    osmrelation: 2700869
    refmegye: "01"
    reftelepules: "011"
----

Names are snake_case by convention, e.g. `kelenfold`. The other fields should match the values you
obtained in the previous bullet point. (`missing-streets: "no"` means that this OSM relation is
only a subset of the referenced settlement, so it's pointless to search for missing streets here.)

- Finally you can send your modification as a https://github.com/vmiklos/osm-gimmisn/pull/new[pull
  request], it'll be probably accepted after review.

== Filtering (out) incorrect information

This action is similar to adding a new relation, but in this case you'll need to work with a file
dedicated to detailed information about the relation. The path derives from the relation name, e.g.
`relation-magasut.yaml`. Consider the case when you browse the Magasút (area) house number coverage
and you see a hint that the odd side of Magasúti köz (street) misses a house number: 999. Let's also
assume that you did your survey and you know that there is no such house number to be added to the
OSM database. The following steps area needed to silence this hint of osm-gimmisn:

- Survey the Magasúti köz street and note down which odd and even house number ranges are present
  for the street. Usually there are tables at the corners showing this information.

- Let's assume you found that the odd side is 1 to 9, the even side is 2 to 8. Now you just need to
  describe this, and osm-gimmisn will infer that 999 is noise in the reference data.

- Edit the `relation-magasut.yaml` file. If there is no such file, then the easiest is to copy an
  existing one and delete all streets.

- You can describe the Magasúti köz street like this:

----
  Magasúti köz:
    ranges:
      - {start: '1', end: '9'}
      - {start: '2', end: '8'}
----

This is a machine-readable way of describing your survey result. In case the OSM and the reference
name of the street differs, use the OSM name here.

- Send a https://github.com/vmiklos/osm-gimmisn/pull/new[pull request] to contribute your created
  filter, and then the website will be updated accordingly.

In other words, there is only minimal filtering for the reference data (1-999 and 2-998 is
accepted) by default. If you want to filter out noise, then you need to cover the correct house
numbers with ranges, and whatever is not in this range will be filtered out.

An alternative way of filtering out invalid data from the reference is explicitly stating what items
are invalid:

----
  Magasúti köz:
    invalid: ['7', '11']
----

Sometimes this results in a more compact filter than the above presented `ranges` way.

== Searching for missing streets

The yaml format is like this:

- `missing-streets: only`: this is provided in the root of the `relation-NAME.yaml` file (by
  convention). It denotes that you only want to search for streets in this (potentially large)
  relation. Other valid values are `yes` (which is the default) and `no`.

== Advanced topics

Apart from filtering out noise, you can also specify other settings, though these are needed less
frequently:

- `refstreets`: this key can be used in the root of a relation file, it's used to describe street
  name mappings, in case the OSM name and reference name differs and the OSM one is the correct
  name.

- `reftelepules`: this key can be used for a street. In case the majority of a relation has a given
  `reftelepules` value, but there are a few exceptions, then you can use this markup to override the
  relation-level value with a street-level one.

- Range-level `reftelepules`: this is useful in case the two sides of a street has different
  `reftelepules` values (that side of the street belongs to a different district or settlement).

- `interpolation`: this key can be specified for a street. Its `all` value means that the street has
  continuous numbering instead of even and odd sides.

- `inactive: true`: this key can be used for a relation, it disables the daily update (which would
  be a waste if e.g. the relation already has 100% coverage.) Manual updates are still possible.

- You can download a GPX file showing the streets of the missing house numbers if you follow the
  'Overpass turbo query for the below streets' link on the missing housenumbers page. To do this,
  visit the 'Overpass turbo' site from the toolbar, copy the query, run it, choose Export -> Download
  as GPX, and e.g. load the result into OsmAnd on your phone.

- `housenumber-letters: true`: this key can be used to do micro-mapping, i.e. detect that e.g. 42/B
  is missing, even if 42/A is already mapped. (The default behavior is to ignore any noise after the
  numeric value of the house numbers.)

- `alias: ["foo", "bar"]`: this key can be used on relations to specify old names. This way
  bookmarks keep working, even in case a relation is renamed.
