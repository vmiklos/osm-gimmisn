= Install instructions

== HW requirements

- single CPU core should be enough

- at least 1GB memory

- at least 1GB of disk space

== Install steps

- Install locale support: i.e. in case `locale -a|grep hu_HU.utf8` reports nothing, you can fix that
  on e.g. Fedora using `dnf install glibc-langpack-hu`.

- Install `git`

- Install Python (3.6 or newer)

- Install `npm` (If the version in your distribution is too old: `sudo npm install -g n && sudo n stable`)

- Install `make`

- Clone the repo:

----
git clone <URL> # You read this file somewhere, right? :-)
cd osm-gimmisn
----

- Set up a virtual environment:

----
python3 -m venv osm-gimmisn-env
. osm-gimmisn-env/bin/activate
----

This makes sure that you will have exactly the same version of the depdendencies as everyone else.

- Install the dependencies (Python, node and eslint):

----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

- Build the generated code and data:

----
make
----

- Run the tests:

----
make check
----

- Create a local config and working directory:

----
mkdir workdir
----

Populate the reference directory with TSV files for the house number and street list.

== Developer setup

----
make run
----

This allows accessing your local instance for development.

== Production setup

- The launcher is `target/release/rouille`.

- A sample `osm-gimmisn.service` is provided, you can copy that to
  `/etc/systemd/system/osm-gimmisn.service` and customize it to your needs.

- Use `systemctl start osm-gimmisn.service` to run the app server.

- Optionally, set up a reverse proxy with SSL support.

- Optionally, add `cron` as a daily crontab:

----
# daily, at 0:05
5 0 * * * /home/osm-gimmisn/git/osm-gimmisn/target/release/cron --mode all
----

See `target/release/cron --help` for details on what switches are supported for that tool.
