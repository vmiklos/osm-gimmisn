Finds objects missing from the OSM DB. As a start, it finds missing streets and house numbers based
on a reference list.

The latest version is v6.0, released on 2020-05-22.  See the
https://github.com/vmiklos/osm-gimmisn/blob/master/NEWS.adoc[release notes].

== Description

It works by fetching the street and house number list for a relation (area), then suggesting what
possibly missing objects are a good idea to survey.
